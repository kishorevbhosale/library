### Detailed Backend Solution Design

#### 1. **Components Overview**
1. **Authentication Service**: Manages user login, sessions, and role-based access.
2. **Booking Service**: Handles room booking logic, including availability checks.
3. **Notification Service**: Sends email/SMS notifications for reminders and alerts.
4. **Admin Service**: Provides functionality for staff to manage bookings and generate reports.
5. **Database**: Stores user data, room availability, bookings, and logs.

#### 2. **Technologies**
- **Backend Framework**: Java (Spring Boot)
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs
- **Database**: SQL/NoSQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB)
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for asynchronous processing (e.g., sending notifications)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Notification**: Email (SMTP server), SMS (Twilio)

### 3. **Detailed Solution Design**

#### 3.1 Authentication Service
**Endpoints**:
- `POST /login`: Authenticates user and returns JWT.
- `POST /logout`: Invalidates the session token.
- `POST /register`: Registers new users (students and staff).

**Key Functions**:
- **User Authentication**: Validate credentials, generate JWT, and manage sessions.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Enforce role-based permissions.

**Edge Cases**:
- Invalid login attempts: Lock account after multiple failed attempts.
- Password reset: Allow users to reset passwords securely.
- Session expiration: Automatically expire sessions after a defined period.

**Future Scope**:
- **OAuth Integration**: Allow login via third-party services (e.g., Google, Facebook).

#### 3.2 Booking Service
**Endpoints**:
- `GET /rooms/availability`: Returns available rooms and time slots.
- `POST /bookings`: Creates a new booking.
- `PUT /bookings/:id/check-in`: Updates booking status to checked-in.
- `PUT /bookings/:id/check-out`: Updates booking status to checked-out.
- `DELETE /bookings/:id`: Cancels a booking.

**Key Functions**:
- **Booking Logic**: Check room availability, create bookings, and manage check-ins/check-outs.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle booking conflicts (e.g., double bookings).

**Edge Cases**:
- Overlapping bookings: Prevent double bookings by implementing locks or transaction management.
- Room capacity: Ensure bookings do not exceed room capacity.
- Time zone differences: Handle bookings across different time zones.

**Future Scope**:
- **Online Payments**: Integrate payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for paid bookings.
- **Booking Extensions**: Allow users to extend booking times if no conflicting bookings exist.

#### 3.3 Notification Service
**Endpoints**:
- `POST /notifications`: Sends notifications (reminders, alerts).

**Key Functions**:
- **Email Notifications**: Use SMTP to send email reminders and alerts.
- **SMS Notifications**: Integrate with SMS gateways (e.g., Twilio) for SMS notifications.

**Edge Cases**:
- Delivery failures: Implement retry logic for failed email/SMS deliveries.
- Notification overload: Rate limit notifications to prevent spam.

**Future Scope**:
- **Push Notifications**: Integrate with push notification services (e.g., Firebase) for mobile notifications.

#### 3.4 Admin Service
**Endpoints**:
- `GET /admin/bookings`: Retrieves all bookings.
- `PUT /admin/bookings/:id`: Updates booking status (approve/cancel/modify).
- `GET /admin/reports`: Generates reports on room usage and booking statistics.

**Key Functions**:
- **Booking Management**: Approve, modify, or cancel bookings.
- **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on room usage and booking statistics.

**Edge Cases**:
- Data integrity: Ensure data consistency during bulk updates or report generation.
- Access control: Ensure only authorized staff can access admin functions.

**Future Scope**:
- **Advanced Reporting**: Implement more complex analytics and reporting features.

#### 3.5 Database Design
**Tables**:
- **Users Table**: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role` (student/staff), `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Rooms Table**: `room_id`, `room_name`, `capacity`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Bookings Table**: `booking_id`, `user_id`, `room_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `status` (booked/cancelled/checked-in/completed), `check_in_time`, `check_out_time`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Notifications Table**: `notification_id`, `user_id`, `booking_id`, `message`, `sent_at`
- **Logs Table**: `log_id`, `action`, `details`, `created_at`

#### 3.6 API Design
**General Guidelines**:
- **Versioning**: Use versioned endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to manage changes over time.
- **Error Handling**: Standardize error responses with meaningful messages and status codes.
- **Security**: Ensure all endpoints are secured with JWT authentication and HTTPS.

#### 3.7 Scalability and Future-Proofing
- **Microservices Architecture**: Design services as independent microservices to facilitate scalability and maintainability.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use messaging systems (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous processing and communication between services.
- **Containerization**: Use Docker and Kubernetes for deployment and orchestration.
- **CI/CD**: Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

### Summary
By following these detailed solution design steps, the study room management system will be robust, scalable, and easily extendable to accommodate future requirements like online payments and push notifications. The design ensures role-based access control, efficient booking management, reliable notifications, and comprehensive admin tools, while also considering edge cases and future-proofing the system for additional services and functionality.
