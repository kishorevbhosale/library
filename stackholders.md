### Detailed System Design for Maintaining Records and Role-Based Access

#### 1. **Stakeholders and Responsibilities**

**1.1 Students**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Register and manage their own accounts.
  - Book study rooms for specific time slots.
  - Check room availability.
  - Check-in and check-out for their booked study rooms.
  - Receive notifications about bookings, reminders, and updates.

**1.2 Library Staff**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Approve or reject student registrations.
  - Manage room bookings (approve, cancel, modify).
  - Monitor room usage and availability.
  - Generate and view reports on room usage and booking statistics.
  - Handle conflicts and issues related to bookings and room usage.

**1.3 IT Support Team**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Maintain and manage the backend system.
  - Ensure data security and system integrity.
  - Handle technical issues and provide support.
  - Implement updates and enhancements to the system.
  - Monitor system performance and optimize as needed.

#### 2. **Access Control Based on Roles**

**2.1 User Roles**
- **Student**: Basic access to book and manage their own study room bookings.
- **Library Staff**: Elevated access to manage all student bookings and view reports.
- **IT Support**: Administrative access to maintain and manage the system.

**2.2 Access Control Mechanism**
- Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to system features based on user roles.
- Implement an authentication and authorization system to ensure users can only access features appropriate to their role.

### 3. **System Components**

#### 3.1 User Interface
- **Login Page**: Common login interface for all users with role-based redirection.
- **Student Dashboard**: Displays personal bookings, room availability, and allows booking management.
- **Staff Dashboard**: Displays all bookings, room availability, conflict resolution, and reporting tools.
- **IT Support Dashboard**: System monitoring tools, user management, and logs access.

#### 3.2 Backend Services
- **Authentication Service**: Manages user login, roles, and sessions.
- **Booking Service**: Handles the logic for creating, updating, and canceling bookings.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users about bookings, reminders, and updates.
- **Admin Service**: Provides functionalities for staff to manage bookings and generate reports.
- **System Monitoring Service**: Allows IT support to monitor system health and performance.

### 4. **Database Design**
- **Users Table**: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role` (student/staff/IT support)
- **Rooms Table**: `room_id`, `room_name`, `capacity`
- **Bookings Table**: `booking_id`, `user_id`, `room_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `status` (booked/checked-in/completed/cancelled)
- **Notifications Table**: `notification_id`, `user_id`, `booking_id`, `message`, `sent_at`
- **Logs Table**: `log_id`, `action`, `details`, `created_at`

### 5. **API Endpoints**
- **Authentication**:
  - `POST /login`: User login
  - `POST /logout`: User logout
- **Booking**:
  - `GET /rooms/availability`: Check available rooms
  - `POST /bookings`: Create a new booking
  - `PUT /bookings/:id/check-in`: Check-in to a booking
  - `PUT /bookings/:id/check-out`: Check-out of a booking
  - `DELETE /bookings/:id`: Cancel a booking
- **Admin**:
  - `GET /admin/bookings`: List all bookings
  - `PUT /admin/bookings/:id`: Update booking status
  - `GET /admin/reports`: Generate usage reports
- **System Monitoring**:
  - `GET /monitoring/status`: Check system status
  - `GET /monitoring/logs`: View system logs

### 6. **User Interface Design**

**6.1 Login Page**
- Fields: Email, Password
- Role-based redirection to respective dashboards after login.

**6.2 Student Dashboard**
- **View Available Rooms**: Display list of available rooms and time slots.
- **My Bookings**: List of current and past bookings with options to cancel or check-in.
- **Notifications**: List of received notifications and alerts.

**6.3 Library Staff Dashboard**
- **Manage Bookings**: View, approve, modify, or cancel student bookings.
- **Room Availability**: Real-time view of room occupancy and availability.
- **Reports**: Generate and view reports on room usage, booking statistics, etc.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Tools for resolving booking conflicts and no-shows.

**6.4 IT Support Dashboard**
- **System Status**: Real-time monitoring of system health and performance metrics.
- **User Management**: Add, update, or remove users and manage roles.
- **Logs Access**: View system and user activity logs for troubleshooting and audit purposes.

### 7. **Security Measures**
- **Authentication**: Secure login with hashed passwords.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control to restrict functionalities based on user roles.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain logs of all critical actions and access for auditing and troubleshooting.
- **Regular Updates**: Implement regular software updates and patches to address vulnerabilities.

### 8. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components and services.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure different components work together as expected.
- **Performance Testing**: Test the system under load to ensure it can handle peak usage.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Get feedback from a group of users to ensure the system meets their needs.

### 9. **Deployment and Maintenance**
- **Deployment Strategy**: Use CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring tools and logging for error tracking and performance analysis.
- **Maintenance Plan**: Regular updates, security patches, and user support.

By outlining these details, the study room management system will be well-defined, secure, and efficient, catering to the needs of students, library staff, and IT support teams while providing appropriate access based on user roles.
